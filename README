mysql-slow-query-log-visualizer
----------

Usage :
- First, upload a mysql slow.log file (not that ATM, big files are not handled correctly)
  If you need to load very great files, you will need to use chrome and launch chrome with `--js-flags="--max-old-space-size=5000"` in order to
  allocate 5GB to chrome and avoid memory errors due to huge load of things in memory.
  Another command to know if you have huge file, is to split your file into several files : `split --bytes=512M --additional-suffix=.log slow.log slow.`
- A timegraph of your queries will be displayed, with every queries displayed
- If you click points on the graph, you will limit the displayed queries with low/high time bounds
- In the displayed queries, some columns may be of interest :
-- query string : original query string executed, and being slow. Note that this query will display parameters
   as is, even if you used prepared statements
-- query with stripped where clauses : some transformations are applied on origin query string in order
   to remove hardcoded values (in order to facilitate identification of same queries with different criteria values)
-- query pattern occurences : Number of time `query with stripped where clauses` occurences are found
   First number is the number of occurences
