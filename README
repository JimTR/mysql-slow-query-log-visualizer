- If you click points on the graph, you will limit the displayed queries with low/high time bounds
- In the displayed queries, some columns may be of interest :
-- query string : original query string executed, and being slow. Note that this query will display parameters
   as is, even if you used prepared statements
-- query with stripped where clauses : some transformations are applied on origin query string in order
   to remove hardcoded values (in order to facilitate identification of same queries with different criteria values)
-- query pattern occurences : Number of time `query with stripped where clauses` occurences are found
   First number is the number of occurences
